  <h2>Dishes offered</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Ugali (Cornmeal Staple)
    The undeniable most common Kenyan food staple is ugali – usually made from cornmeal that is added to boiling water and heated until it turns into a dense block of cornmeal paste. Ugali has the consistency of a grainy dough and the heaviness of a brick.
    
    For many Kenyans, ugali along with a small amount of cooked vegetables or saucy stew is a normal meal.</li>
    
    <li> Irio (Mashed Peas and Potato Mix)
    Irio is one of the most famous dishes in Kenya, a food that originated as a Kikuyu staple and spread throughout the country.
    
    Green peas and potatoes are boiled and then mashed up before whole kernels of maize (corn) are added to give the mash some extra starch and texture. This hearty and heavy Kenyan food is famous to eat with roasted nyama choma meat (nyama na irio) or just some Kenyan style stew.</li>
    
        
    <li> Kenyan Githeri (Beans and Corn)
    It’s not too complicated, a Kenyan dish that consists of boiled beans, corn kernels, and possibly mixed in with a little bit of vegetables.
    
    The combination of Githeri is a filling, highly nutritious, and can be quite good when complimented with salt, pepper, chilies, and even a chapati!</li>
    
    <li> Pilau (Spiced Rice)
    Pilau is a glorified combination of rice cooked with flavor bursting spices like cumin, cardamon, cinnamon, and cloves. The fragrant rice is fantastic to eat with a form of meat stew and a few slices of fresh tomato and onions.
    
    Biriyani is another form of spiced rice that is a popular Kenyan food on the coast.</li>
    
    
    <li> Wali wa Nazi (Coconut Rice)
    Coconut rice is a popular Kenyan food mostly along the Indian Ocean coast. White rice is cooked with grated coconut meat to create a fragrant twist on plain boiled rice. Wali wa nazi is best enjoyed with a serving of fish or chicken curry, some vegetables, or even bean stew.</li>
   
    <li> Sukuma Wiki (Collard Greens / Kale)
    One of the most popular vegetable Kenyan dishes is sukuma wiki (known as collard greens or a form of kale in English).
    
    The nutritious green leafy vegetable is often cooked in oil with a few diced tomatoes, onions, and flavored with a sprinkle of mchuzi mix (Kenyan food secret flavoring salt – MSG) or stock cube flavoring.</li>
    
    <li> Kenyan Stew
    Kenyan stew can include a number of different meats: beef stew, goat stew, chicken stew or any other animal stew. Kenyan stew dishes might also include a few other base vegetable ingredients such as carrots, peppers, peas, or potatoes. The sauce is usually formed from a light tomato base and accented with onion, salt and pepper, and that essential mchuzi mix!</li>
    
    
    <li> Nyama Choma (Roasted Meat) – Pride of Kenyan Food
    Any Kenyan food list is not complete without a mention of nyama choma, also known as roasted meat. Goat and beef are the 2 most common forms of nyama choma, but chicken (kuku choma) and fish (samaki choma) are also valid choices.
    
    Fat and the grizzle from the meat is the choice part of the animal, and is often consumed with a quick dip into a pile of salt for extra flavoring! It’s also possible at many places to get the “fry,” – the fried meat variation.</li>
    
    
    <li> Matoke (Plantain Banana Stew)
    Matoke is originally a dish from Uganda, though it is widely available and popular in Kenya as well.
    
    Plantain bananas are cooked up in a pot with some oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic, chilies, meat (optional), and lemon juice. The bananas are cooked until they become soft and begin to form a thick sauce with the other ingredients.
    
    The result is a delicious dish that is reminiscent of boiled potatoes in sauce and excellent to eat with rice, ugali, or a chapati.</li>
